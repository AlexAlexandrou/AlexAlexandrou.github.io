The user can select a specific ship to place onto the grid (selection on the left side of the screen) and whether it will be placed horizontally or vertically (selected orientation is highlighted on the right side of the screen)  
* If the user does not place all the ships onto the grid, the game does not start.
* If a ship is placed out of the grid bounds, its placement is removed and it has to be placed again.
