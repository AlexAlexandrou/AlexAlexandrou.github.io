For this project, different datasets containing data on countries and their smart cities as well as the vulnerabilities that apply to them and their severity were used to create visualizations in Splunk.  
The visualizations vary from each other and are placed on different dashboards:
* Countries: Contains visualizations in regards to the countries contained in the datasets.
* Cities: Similarly to the Countries dashboard, it contains all the visualizations regarding the Smart Cities.
* Vulnerabilities: All the visualizations about the vulnerabilities are displayed such as their description, severity and the systems they can exploit.

Additionally, dashbaords containing visualizations about specific assets were also created:
* Selected City
* Selected Country
* Selected Vulnerability
