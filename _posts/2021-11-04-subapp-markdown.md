## App summary
This post contains information regarding the Subscription Management app that I created as my final year project. It also provides some code snippets to show its technical aspects.  
This app allows the users to:  
* Add subscriptions
* View the added subscriptions and their details
* Edit the subscriptions
* View the total amount they spend on subscriptions:
  * Monthly
  * Every 3 months
  * Every 6 months
  * Annually

Additionally, Firebase was used as the database to store the different subscription entries.
